## Background

The purpose of this project is to take in a few years of stock market data and analyze it. That analysis includes tracking the yearly change of each stock, the percent change over a year, and the total volume of each stock. The project was made using Microsoft Visual Basic for Application and allows us to read thousands of data points across multiple spreadsheets in a workbook. 

## Results, Images, and Conclusions

The results of the project are:
- A column which displays each stock's ticker abbreviation
- A column that shows the change in stock price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. 
- A column that shows the percent change in the stock prices from the beginning of the year to the end.
- A column that shows the total volume for each stock 
- Formatting in the yearly change column to show positive and negative yearly change.

### Conclusions
These new columns have several benefits and allow us to more easily draw conclusions. For example, we can now easily see the yearly changes of the stocks since the program finds the starting price and ending price for that year. Also, with the addition of the color coding, it is easier to see positive and negative changes. The percent change column allows us to see percent changes of stocks relative to all the other stocks. This is helpful since looking at the raw yearly increases and decreases can be misleading. We can also see the total volumes of each stock with this program rather than having to parce through the data and caluculate it in a rudimentary fashion.
